## Foreword

As i started playing Pen and Paper i came across the problem to keep my character sheet updated. Therefor i started building this UI as Progressive Web App to keep my character updated without any external dependencies (API, ...).

Currently i'am working on the [Savage Worlds](http://www.savage-run.de/download/1233/) Character implementation.

## Current Features

- Fully Responsive
- Saving Hero automatically while editing
- Export Hero as JSON to save it on your own
- Saving Hero into Browser Localstorage for persistence
- Import Hero into Application from exported JSON

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Current State
Visit my [Github Page](https://hexpy.github.io/PenPaperHero/create) for current version.
